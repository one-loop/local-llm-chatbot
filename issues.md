What can you do
I can assist you with finding menu items, checking their availability, and helping you place an order if you're interested. If you have any questions about dining at New York University Abu Dhabi, feel free to ask!


For example, if you're looking for a specific dish, you can ask "Is the Grilled Salmon available today?" and I'll help you find the answer. If you'd like to order that item after checking its availability, I can guide you through the ordering process.


[ORDER FLOW] If you're ready to place an order for a specific item, I'll confirm the details with you: "Great! I found Grilled Salmon on our menu for AED 65. Would you like to place an order for this item? Please respond with 'yes' to confirm or 'no' to cancel."
```

If you have any other questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to ask!

* Sometimes the bot doesn't get into the oder flow when a user wants to order a specific item and confirms that they want to start the order (i.e. it doesn't request for the user's NYU ID, phone number, building etc.)

Example:
```
Is the grilled salmon available today
Yes, the Grilled Salmon Steak is available today for AED 45.0. Would you like to place an order for this item? Please respond with 'yes' to confirm or 'no' to cancel.

yes
Great! I found the Grilled Salmon Steak on our menu for AED 45.0. To place your order, please let me know if you would like any side dishes or specific cooking instructions. If you don't have a preference, we will serve it with our signature roasted vegetables and mashed potatoes. Once you confirm your order, I'll arrange for it to be delivered to your preferred location at New York University Abu Dhabi. To proceed, please tell me if you would like any side dishes or specific cooking instructions for your Grilled Salmon Steak.
