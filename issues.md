* If the user prompts to order/get information of specific categories of food (e.g. pizza, acai bowls), the bot doesn't respond accurately/access the mcp server. It hallucinates the response

Great! I found "Margherita Pizza" on our menu for AED 15.00. Would you like to place an order for this item? Please respond with 'yes' to confirm or 'no' to cancel.

Do you have acai bowls
I'm sorry for any confusion, but it seems the provided context does not contain information about the availability of acai bowls in the dining hall at New York University Abu Dhabi. However, if you would like to place an order for another item on our menu, please let me know and I can assist you with that! If you are interested in finding out more

* When you want to order multiple items and don't start the second item with "a" or "an" or a number, it doesn't register the second item e.g. "Can I order a pepperoni and margherita pizza?" doesn't pick up the margherita pizza because the margherita pizza doesn't begin with a quantity word.
Example:

```

Can I order a pepperoni pizza and chicken nuggets
